In the image, a woman is standing in a dimly lit room, her gaze directed downwards and to the left. She is dressed in traditional Japanese attire, a kimono adorned with a floral pattern in shades of orange and green. A purple flower is tucked into her hair, adding a touch of color to her ensemble.

She holds a small wooden bucket in her right hand, from which a flame is emerging, casting a warm glow on her surroundings. The bucket is suspended from a metal stand, which is placed on a wooden floor. The room itself is quite simple, with a window visible in the background, suggesting an outdoor setting. The overall scene exudes a sense of tranquility and tradition.
