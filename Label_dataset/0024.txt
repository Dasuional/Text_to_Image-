The sky, painted in hues of orange and red, serves as a stunning backdrop to the majestic mountains that rise in the distance. The mountains, blanketed in snow, stand tall against the vibrant sky.

A river, reflecting the fiery colors of the sky, meanders through the foreground of the image. It's as if the river is mirroring the beauty of the sky above. On either side of the river, trees and bushes, their leaves染上橙红色，点缀着这片雪白的大地。

Overall, the image captures a serene moment in nature, where the elements come together to create a harmonious and awe-inspiring view. It's a testament to the beauty of our natural world, and the power of art to capture and convey it.
