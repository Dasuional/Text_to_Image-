In the image, a young girl is standing in a room that appears to be in disrepair. She is dressed in a blue dress and is looking up at a large dinosaur that has its mouth open wide. The dinosaur, which is green with brown spots, is positioned on the right side of the image. The room they are in is dark, with only a small amount of light illuminating the scene from the left side. The girl's gaze is directed towards the dinosaur, creating a sense of interaction between them. There are no other objects or text present in the image. The relative position of the girl and the dinosaur suggests a moment frozen in time, with the girl seemingly unafraid of the dinosaur's intimidating presence.
