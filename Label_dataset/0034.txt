The image portrays a serene scene of a Mediterranean village at sunset. The village is nestled on a hillside, with houses and buildings of various sizes scattered across the landscape. The buildings are predominantly white and orange, their colors complementing the warm hues of the setting sun.

A path, lined with lush green trees and bushes, meanders through the village, leading the viewer's eye towards the center of the painting. The path is adorned with orange fruits, adding a touch of vibrancy to the scene.

In the distance, the sun is setting behind the mountains, casting a golden glow over the entire scene. The sky above is a soft pink, with the sun appearing as a bright circle in the center. The overall composition of the painting suggests a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere, typical of a Mediterranean village at the end of the day.
